# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

I feel proud of feeling comfortable using conditionals inside of methods and being able to create one method that can adapt to given conditionals or arguments. 

There is so much power in using methods! Many things can be made more efficient by using methods.
